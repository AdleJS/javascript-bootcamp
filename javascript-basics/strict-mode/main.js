"use strict";

// this script works in strict mode
// meaning that it will throw an error if you try to assign a value to an undeclared variable
// and it will throw an error if you try to delete a variable, function, or function argument
// and it will throw an error if you try to use a reserved word as a variable name
// and it will throw an error if you try to use a reserved word as a label
// and it will throw an error if you try to use a reserved word as a function name
// and it will throw an error if you try to use a reserved word as a function argument name
// strict mode automatically enables when you use ES6 modules and classes
